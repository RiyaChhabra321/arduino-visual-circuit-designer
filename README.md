# Arduino-visual-circuit-designer

## Overview
This project is a web-based visual circuit design tool inspired by platforms such as **Wokwi** and **circuito.io**. It allows users to drag and drop Arduino components onto a canvas and automatically generates the corresponding Arduino code based on component configuration.

The goal of this project is to simplify Arduino learning by visually connecting hardware components with auto-generated code.
